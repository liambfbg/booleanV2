I'm just sick of boolean and Boolean tbh, might as well improve them and end the debate.

You could use this for async processes, I might build the functionality to support it easily. 

While waiting, state is PERHAPS, otherwise TRUE or FALSE, null if null. (obviously)

Probably can be used for quantum computing too, but at the same time probable not.
